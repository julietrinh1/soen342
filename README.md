## Project Description
Our project is a food delivery app that is designed to offer a wide range of features in an easy to use format. When examining current food delivery services, we noticed that none of them offer the exact same features. While some of these missing features are focused more on attracting customers, such as a rewards system or an in-app help center, other missing features are more cruicial, such as the ability to look at order history. Our aim is to ensure quality service in all aspects. TO achieve this, we combine the best of all the applications examined, as well as some of our own ideas, and present them in an intuitive layout.
